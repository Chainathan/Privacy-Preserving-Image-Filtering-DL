# Privacy-Preserving-Image-Filtering-Mobile-App
A mobile application that automatically detects and censors sensitive content in images — whether documents or everyday photos — enabling safe and private sharing. The app uses OCR, LLMs, and segmentation models to locate and mask content such as ID cards, credit cards, screens, license plates, QR codes, and confidential text.
